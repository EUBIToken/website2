# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I invest in your project?
The original EUBI token on the MintME blockchain was abandoned due to problems with the MintME.com platform (bad exchange, insecure blockchain, and DogecoinX backstabbing on us), so we deployed 2 new tokens to replace the original one: [bEUBI token on Binance Smart Chain](https://www.beubitoken.com) and PolyEUBI on Polygon Blockchain. For PolyEUBI, we also have a massive 1inch limit order to sell tokens.

Our PolyEUBI presale contract is located at 0xa8b365da6d0d7b41cef3778aa906212c096aaabd. Send some MATIC (Polygon Blockchain) to the smart contract, and it will send you back some PolyEUBI tokens. We send profit shares to HODLers manually for now, since we don't have a lot of HODLers, but we are considering staking contracts and buyback-and-burn in the future. And finally, it is recommended that you use [MyEUBIWallet v2.1](https://wallet.polyeubitoken.com) to store your tokens. MyEUBIWallet v2.1 connects to both Polygon and Binance Smart Chain at the same time using extremely fast Moralis speedy nodes, and uses the most secure and heavily-optimized JavaScript coding standard possible.

## How are your initial token supply allocated?
900,000 PolyEUBI minted to Bela Balog, who is responsible for running the insurance company, like we talked about earlier

100,000 PolyEUBI minted to Jessie Lesbian, who is 100% responsible for the presale

Minting additional tokens is not supported by the token contract, but flash minting is supported.

## Is this a scam?
Short answer: no

Long answer: We always sent profit shares, we haven't missed a single profit share payment since our establishment back in 2020. You can check our CEO's address on blockchain explorers, since he is responsible for making profit shares. Also, we are NOT a ponzi scheme since your money is invested in other projects, and we are not a pyramid scheme since our rewards programs, such as beubiexchange referral program or Reddit meme contest, doesn't come with a starting cost. We are a low-risk/low-reward investment, and you can expect around 30%/year returns if you invest in our token. Unlike most cryptocurrency projects, we are backed by an extremely serious insurance company.

## Why do you invest so much in other projects? Where is the insurance selling?
Insurance companies can pay out more than what they get in premiums since they invest insurance premiums in low-risk and highly-liquid investments. Insurance companies are shockingly similar to banks in many aspects.

## Where is your liquidity mining program?
We don't have one, but we do pay profit shares to liquidity providers for the PolyEUBI part of their liquidity. We are looking at an OlympusDAO-like approach for this though, since we don't believe in rented liquidity due to sustainability concenrns.

## Why do you hold nearly all tokens in circulation?
Simple: we haven't sold them. Please help us sell more tokens by buying more tokens and spread the word.

## Why deploy on so many blockchains?
The decommissioning of the EUBI token was intially recommended by our blockchain director to our CEO due to concerns about the security of the MintME blockchain. When we first launched bEUBI on Binance Smart Chain, we intended to support both EUBI on MintME and bEUBI on Binance Smart Chain. Then, MintME.com raised the fees and DogecoinX backstabbed on us, and that's why we decomissioned the old EUBI token on MintME.

Unless something extremely bad happens to Binance Smart Chain, we are not decommissioning the bEUBI token. Also, we have deployment on rollups like Optimistic Ethereum and zkSync on our to-do list, so please stay tuned by joining our Discord server to not miss those launches! 

## When moon? When lambo?
If you invested in bEUBI tokens, this calculator will come in handy

We are still uncertain about how much profit shares can we send to PolyEUBI HODLers since it's so new.
